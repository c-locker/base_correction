# base_correction

apply base correction on RTK-GNSS measurments when the base-reciever was placed over an arbitrary point und a point with known coordinates was measured. Coordinates have to be cartesian, e.g. UTM.

The sript also calculates an elevation difference, neglecting the minimal deviations of the z-axis to the xy-plain.
